## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Anchor Text Diversity**:
Don't always use "eSIM" or "Lumbus" - vary it:

- "click here" (generic)
- "travel data plans" (partial match)
- "international connectivity" (topical)
- "Lumbus eSIM" (branded)

Don't get 100 backlinks overnight - looks unnatural
- Aim for steady growth: 5-10 quality links per week
- Spikes are OK after PR mentions or launches

### 3. **Relationship Building**:
Best backlinks come from relationships:
- Engage on Twitter with travel bloggers
