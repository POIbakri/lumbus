ARTICLE 1.3: How do I know if my phone is unlocked?
---------------------------------------------------

Your device MUST be carrier-unlocked for Lumbus eSIM to work. Here's how to check and what to do.

Why does my phone need to be unlocked?
Carrier-locked phones are restricted to only use that carrier's network. An unlocked phone can use any compatible carrier, including eSIM providers like Lumbus.

How to check if your iPhone is unlocked:
1. Go to Settings > General > About
2. Scroll down to "Carrier Lock" or "Network Provider Lock"
3. If it says "No SIM restrictions" - your phone is unlocked
4. If it shows a carrier name - your phone may be locked

How to check if your Android is unlocked:
1. Insert a SIM from a different carrier
2. If it works and shows signal, your phone is unlocked
3. If it shows "SIM not supported" or similar, it's likely locked

How to unlock your phone:
1. Contact your current carrier's customer service
2. Request an unlock (you may need to pay off your device first)
3. Follow their instructions to complete the unlock
4. This usually takes 24-72 hours

Phones that are typically unlocked:
- Devices purchased directly from manufacturers (Apple Store, Samsung.com, Google Store)
- Phones bought at full price without a contract
- Devices purchased from unlocked phone retailers

Note: Carrier-locked phones with eSIM capability will show the eSIM option in settings, but it may be restricted to only that carrier. You need a FULLY unlocked device for Lumbus eSIM.


ARTICLE 1.4: How long does eSIM delivery take?
----------------------------------------------

Your eSIM is delivered INSTANTLY after purchase!

What happens after purchase:
1. Payment is processed securely via Stripe
2. Your eSIM is generated within seconds
3. You receive an email with your QR code and activation instructions
4. You can immediately install the eSIM on your device

What you'll receive:
- QR code for scanning
- One-tap installation link (for iOS 17.4+)
- Manual entry codes (SM-DP+ address and activation code)
- Step-by-step installation instructions
- Link to your order dashboard

No waiting for:
- Physical delivery
- Shipping times
- Customs clearance
- Postal services

Pro tip: Install your eSIM before your trip so you're ready to connect the moment you land!


=====================================
CATEGORY 2: INSTALLATION & SETUP
=====================================


ARTICLE 2.1: How do I install my eSIM?
--------------------------------------

Installing your Lumbus eSIM is quick and easy. Follow the instructions for your device type.

For iPhone (iOS 17.4 and newer) - One-Tap Install:

3. Enter the SM-DP+ address from your email
4. Enter the Activation Code from your email
5. Complete the installation

CRITICAL - After Installation:
You MUST enable Data Roaming for your eSIM to work! See "Do I need to enable Data Roaming?" article.


ARTICLE 2.2: Do I need to enable Data Roaming? (IMPORTANT!)
-----------------------------------------------------------

YES! Data Roaming MUST be turned ON for your eSIM to work. This is the #1 reason customers experience connection issues.

Why is Data Roaming required?
Lumbus eSIMs use partner networks in your destination country. Your phone treats this as "roaming" even though it's covered by your prepaid plan. Without Data Roaming enabled, your phone will refuse to connect.

How to enable Data Roaming on iPhone:
1. Go to Settings > Cellular (or Mobile Data)
2. Tap on your Lumbus eSIM (it may show as "Travel" or "Secondary")
3. Find "Data Roaming" toggle
4. Turn it ON (green)

How to enable Data Roaming on Android:
1. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > SIMs
2. Tap on your Lumbus eSIM
3. Find "Roaming" or "Data Roaming" toggle
4. Turn it ON

Important notes:
- Only enable Data Roaming for your Lumbus eSIM, not your primary SIM (to avoid unexpected charges)
- Enable Data Roaming when you arrive at your destination
- Your prepaid data is included - you won't be charged extra for roaming
- If Data Roaming is off, you'll see "No Service" or have no internet connection

Troubleshooting:
If you still have no connection after enabling Data Roaming:
1. Toggle Airplane Mode on and off
2. Restart your phone
3. Make sure your Lumbus eSIM is set as the data line
4. Check that you're in a covered area


ARTICLE 2.3: When should I install my eSIM?
-------------------------------------------

You can install your eSIM ANYTIME after purchase - we recommend installing before your trip!

Recommended approach:
1. Purchase your eSIM a few days before your trip
2. Install the eSIM while you still have WiFi (at home, hotel, etc.)
3. Keep Data Roaming OFF until you arrive at your destination
4. Enable Data Roaming when you land - this starts your validity period

Why install before your trip?
- Ensures everything is set up correctly before you leave
- No stress trying to install at the airport or on arrival
- You can test that the eSIM appears correctly in your settings
- You're ready to connect the moment you land

When does my validity period start?
Your plan validity (e.g., 30 days) starts when you first connect to a network in your destination with Data Roaming enabled - NOT when you purchase or install the eSIM.

Example timeline:
- Monday: Purchase Lumbus eSIM for Japan
- Tuesday: Install eSIM at home (validity NOT started yet)
- Friday: Arrive in Japan, enable Data Roaming
- Friday: Validity period (e.g., 30 days) begins now

Can I install at the airport/on arrival?
Yes, but you'll need:
- WiFi connection to download the eSIM
- Access to your confirmation email
- A few minutes to complete setup

It's much easier to do this beforehand!


ARTICLE 2.4: What if I can't scan the QR code?
----------------------------------------------

If you can't scan the QR code, don't worry! There are alternative installation methods.

Manual Entry Method:
1. Go to your device's eSIM settings
2. Select "Enter Details Manually" or "Use activation code"
3. Enter the SM-DP+ address (also called "server address")
4. Enter the Activation Code
5. Complete the installation as normal

Where to find manual entry codes:
- In your confirmation email from Lumbus
- On your order installation page (link provided in email)
- In your Lumbus dashboard

Common QR code scanning issues:

Problem: Camera won't focus on QR code
Solution: Clean your camera lens, ensure good lighting, try moving closer/further from the screen

Problem: QR code displayed on same device
Solution: You can't scan a QR code displayed on the same phone. Options:
- Use the one-tap installation link instead
- Display QR on another device (computer, tablet, another phone)
- Print the QR code
- Use manual entry method

Problem: "Invalid QR code" error
Solution: Make sure you're scanning the eSIM QR code, not a different QR code in the email. If issues persist, use manual entry.

Problem: No camera option in eSIM settings
Solution: Your device may only support manual entry. Enter the codes as described above.

For iOS 17.4+ users:
Skip the QR code entirely! Use the one-tap "Activate without QR" link in your email for automatic installation.


ARTICLE 2.5: Can I install the eSIM before my trip?
---------------------------------------------------

YES! We actually recommend installing your eSIM before you travel.

Benefits of pre-installation:
- Peace of mind knowing everything is set up
- No rushing at the airport or on arrival
- Test that the eSIM appears correctly in your device
- Ready to connect instantly when you land
- Troubleshoot any issues while you still have support access

How it works:
1. Purchase your eSIM (instant delivery)
2. Install the eSIM on your device using WiFi
3. The eSIM will show in your settings but won't use data yet
4. Keep Data Roaming OFF until you reach your destination
5. When you arrive, turn on Data Roaming
6. Your validity period starts when you first connect

What you'll see after installation:
- Your eSIM will appear in Cellular/SIM settings
- It may show "No Service" or "Not Active" - this is normal before traveling
- The eSIM is ready and waiting to connect

Important reminders:
- Only turn on Data Roaming for the Lumbus eSIM when you arrive
- Keep your primary SIM's Data Roaming OFF to avoid charges
- Your prepaid data won't be consumed until you enable roaming at your destination


=====================================
CATEGORY 3: USING YOUR eSIM
=====================================


ARTICLE 3.1: Do I need to remove my primary SIM card?
-----------------------------------------------------

NO! Your eSIM works alongside your existing SIM card. You can use both simultaneously.

How dual SIM works:
Modern smartphones support "Dual SIM" functionality, meaning they can use:
- One physical SIM card (your current carrier)
- One eSIM (your Lumbus travel data)

Typical setup while traveling:
- Primary SIM: Keep for receiving calls/SMS (if needed)
- Lumbus eSIM: Use for mobile data

How to configure in your phone settings:

iPhone:
1. Go to Settings > Cellular
2. Under "Cellular Plans" you'll see both SIMs
3. Tap "Cellular Data" and select your Lumbus eSIM for data
4. Your primary SIM can still handle calls/texts

Android:
1. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > SIMs
2. You'll see both SIM cards listed
3. Set Lumbus eSIM as your "Mobile data" SIM
4. Keep your primary SIM for calls if needed

Benefits of keeping your primary SIM:
- Receive important calls and texts
- Keep your phone number accessible
- No need to notify contacts of a new number
- Easy to switch back when you return home

Using WiFi Calling:
If you want to avoid roaming charges on your primary SIM while abroad:
- Enable WiFi Calling on your primary SIM
- Use the Lumbus eSIM data for internet
- Make calls over WiFi using your home number


ARTICLE 3.2: Can I use hotspot/tethering?
-----------------------------------------

YES! All Lumbus eSIM plans support mobile hotspot and tethering at no extra charge.

What is hotspot/tethering?
Hotspot allows you to share your mobile data connection with other devices like:
- Laptops
- Tablets
- Other phones
- Cameras or other WiFi devices

How to enable hotspot:

iPhone:
1. Go to Settings > Personal Hotspot
2. Toggle "Allow Others to Join" ON
3. Note the WiFi password shown
4. Connect your other devices to the hotspot network

Android:
1. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Hotspot & tethering
2. Tap "WiFi hotspot" and toggle it ON
3. Configure the network name and password if desired
4. Connect your other devices

Tips for using hotspot efficiently:
- Hotspot uses more battery - keep your phone plugged in if possible
- Data is shared across all connected devices
- Streaming video on connected devices uses data quickly
- Disconnect devices when not in use to save data

Data usage reminder:
Your hotspot data comes from your eSIM plan allowance (e.g., 5GB, 10GB). Heavy usage like video streaming or large downloads will consume data faster. Monitor your usage in your Lumbus dashboard or phone settings.


ARTICLE 3.3: What speeds can I expect?
--------------------------------------

You'll get 4G/LTE or 5G speeds depending on your plan and local network availability.

Network types:
- 5G: Fastest speeds, available in major cities and select areas
- 4G/LTE: Fast and reliable, widely available
- 3G: Backup in areas with limited coverage (slower speeds)

Typical speed ranges:
- 5G: 100-500+ Mbps download
- 4G/LTE: 10-100 Mbps download
- 3G: 1-5 Mbps download

What affects your speed?
1. Network coverage - Urban areas typically have faster networks
2. Network congestion - Peak times may be slower
3. Your device - Older phones may not support 5G
4. Location - Indoor/underground areas may have weaker signal
5. Distance from tower - Closer = stronger signal

Speed is sufficient for:
- GPS navigation and maps
- Messaging apps (WhatsApp, iMessage, Telegram)
- Social media browsing and posting
- Email and web browsing
- Video calls (Zoom, FaceTime, Google Meet)
- Streaming music and podcasts
- Streaming video (Netflix, YouTube)

Note: Lumbus eSIMs automatically connect to the best available network in your destination. We partner with premium local carriers to ensure reliable coverage.


ARTICLE 3.4: What happens when I run out of data?
-------------------------------------------------

When you use all your data or your validity period expires, your connection will stop. Here's what to know and how to top up.

What happens:
- Your mobile data connection stops working
- You'll need WiFi for internet access
- Your eSIM remains installed on your device
- You can purchase additional data

How to check your data usage:
1. In your phone settings: Go to Cellular/Mobile Data settings to see usage
2. Lumbus Dashboard: Log in at getlumbus.com to see real-time usage statistics
3. Email alerts: We'll notify you when you're running low (if applicable)

How to get more data (Top-up):

If your plan supports top-ups:
1. Log in to your Lumbus dashboard
2. Find your active eSIM
3. Select "Top Up" or "Add Data"
4. Choose a top-up package
5. Complete payment
6. Additional data is added instantly

If top-up isn't available:
- You can purchase a new eSIM plan
- Install the new eSIM (your device can hold multiple eSIMs)
- Switch to the new eSIM for data

Validity period vs. Data:
- Data limit reached: Your connection stops even if validity period remains
- Validity period expired: Your connection stops even if data remains
- Whichever happens first ends your service

Pro tip: Monitor your usage periodically, especially if streaming video or using hotspot, as these consume data quickly.


ARTICLE 3.5: Can I use my eSIM in multiple devices?
---------------------------------------------------

NO - each eSIM can only be installed on ONE device.

Why is this?
eSIMs are designed as single-device plans for security and fair usage. Once an eSIM is installed and activated on a device, the activation codes become invalid for other devices.

What this means:
- Install only on the device you'll be using
- Cannot transfer an active eSIM to another phone
- Cannot share one eSIM between family members' devices
- Once installed, it's locked to that device

If you need connectivity on multiple devices:

Option 1: Use Hotspot/Tethering
- Install the eSIM on your primary phone
- Enable hotspot to share data with laptop, tablet, etc.
- All devices share the same data allowance

Option 2: Purchase Multiple eSIMs
- Buy separate eSIM plans for each device
- Each device has its own data allowance
- Independence for each user/device

What if I get a new phone?
- Your existing eSIM cannot be transferred
- You would need to purchase a new eSIM for the new device
- Contact support if you haven't activated your current eSIM

Accidental installation on wrong device:
If you haven't used any data yet, contact support immediately. We may be able to help, but this isn't guaranteed as activation codes are typically single-use.

ARTICLE 5.5: Why is my device not showing the eSIM option?
----------------------------------------------------------

If your device should support eSIM but you can't find the option, here are possible causes and solutions.

Reason 1: Device is carrier-locked
Even if your phone model supports eSIM, a carrier lock can disable the feature.

Solution:
- Contact your carrier to unlock your device
- Phones purchased outright are usually unlocked
- Contract phones may need to be paid off first

Reason 2: Software needs updating
Some eSIM features require recent OS versions.

Solution:
- iPhone: Settings > General > Software Update
- Android: Settings > System > Software Update
- Install any available updates and restart

Reason 3: Looking in wrong location

iPhone eSIM settings:
- Settings > Cellular > Add eSIM (or Add Cellular Plan)
- On older iOS: Settings > Cellular > Add Cellular Plan

Android eSIM settings:
- Settings > Network & Internet > SIMs > Add eSIM
- Or: Settings > Connections > SIM Manager
- Menu names vary by manufacturer

Reason 4: eSIM already at capacity
Most phones support limited eSIM profiles (usually 5-10).

Solution:
- Go to eSIM settings
- Remove old/unused eSIM profiles
- Then try adding a new one

Reason 5: Device doesn't actually support eSIM
Some devices have eSIM hardware but it's disabled, or the model variant doesn't support it.

Solution:
- Check your specific model number
- Look up "eSIM support" for your exact device
- Regional variants may differ

Reason 6: Regional restrictions
Some carriers or regions have eSIM restrictions.

Solution:
- Insert a local SIM first to enable eSIM
- Or use the device in a different region

Still can't find eSIM option?
Contact your device manufacturer or carrier for model-specific guidance.

US iPhone 14 and newer:
iPhones sold in the US from iPhone 14 onwards are "eSIM only" - they don't have a physical SIM tray. These fully support eSIM.

China models:
iPhone models sold in mainland China may have different eSIM availability. Check your specific model.

Menu locations vary:
Android manufacturers use different menu structures:
- Samsung: Settings > Connections > SIM Manager
- Google: Settings > Network & Internet > SIMs
- OnePlus: Settings > WiFi & Network > SIM & Network

Software version:
Make sure your Android is updated to the latest version for full eSIM functionality.


ARTICLE 6.3: Does my phone need to be unlocked for eSIM?
--------------------------------------------------------

YES - your device must be carrier-unlocked to use Lumbus eSIM.

What is carrier lock?
When you buy a phone through a carrier (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, EE, Vodafone, etc.) on a contract or payment plan, it may be "locked" to only work with that carrier's network. This restriction also applies to eSIM.

How to check if your phone is locked:

iPhone:
1. Settings > General > About
2. Scroll to "Carrier Lock"
3. If it says "No SIM restrictions" = Unlocked
4. If it shows a carrier name = May be locked

Android:
1. Insert a SIM from a different carrier
2. If it works = Unlocked
3. If you see "SIM not allowed" or similar = Locked

How to unlock your phone:

1. Contact your carrier's customer service
   - Call or visit their website
   - Request device unlock

2. Requirements vary by carrier:
   - Device may need to be paid off
   - Account must be in good standing
   - May need to be with carrier for X months
   - Some carriers charge an unlock fee

3. Wait for confirmation
   - Unlocking usually takes 24-72 hours
   - You'll receive confirmation email/text

4. Complete the unlock
   - Some phones require a restart
   - Some need a new SIM inserted to complete

Phones that are typically already unlocked:
- Bought directly from Apple, Google, Samsung stores
- Purchased at full price (no contract)
- Bought from third-party retailers as "unlocked"
- Older phones where contract has ended

If you can't unlock your phone:
Unfortunately, we cannot bypass carrier locks. The only solution is to unlock through your carrier or use an already unlocked device.


ARTICLE 6.4: Can I use eSIM and physical SIM at the same time?
--------------------------------------------------------------

YES! Most eSIM-compatible phones support dual SIM functionality - using both a physical SIM and eSIM simultaneously.

How dual SIM works:
Your phone maintains two active cellular connections:
- Physical SIM (Primary): Your regular carrier for calls/texts
- eSIM (Lumbus): Travel data while abroad

Benefits of using both:
- Keep your regular phone number active
- Receive calls and texts as normal
- Use Lumbus data without switching SIMs
- No need to swap physical cards

How to configure dual SIM:

iPhone:
1. Go to Settings > Cellular
2. You'll see both lines listed
3. Tap "Cellular Data" and choose your Lumbus eSIM for data
4. Configure "Default Voice Line" for calls
5. Set your preferred line for SMS

Android:
1. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > SIMs
2. Both SIMs will be listed
3. Set "Mobile data" to your Lumbus eSIM
4. Configure call/SMS preferences as desired

Recommended travel setup:

Function            SIM to Use
Mobile Data         Lumbus eSIM
Voice Calls         Primary SIM (or WiFi calling)
SMS                 Primary SIM
iMessage/WhatsApp   Uses data (Lumbus eSIM)

Data roaming on primary SIM:
IMPORTANT: Keep Data Roaming OFF on your primary SIM to avoid unexpected charges. Only enable Data Roaming on your Lumbus eSIM.

Does dual SIM use more battery?
Slightly, but the difference is minimal on modern phones. Both radios are designed to be power efficient.


ARTICLE 6.5: Does eSIM work on tablets and smartwatches?
--------------------------------------------------------

YES - eSIM works on compatible tablets and smartwatches with cellular capability.

Compatible iPad models:
- iPad Pro 11-inch (all generations)
- iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and newer)
- iPad Air (3rd generation and newer)
- iPad (7th generation and newer)
- iPad mini (5th generation and newer)

How to add eSIM to iPad:
1. Settings > Cellular Data
2. Tap "Add eSIM" or "Add a New Plan"
3. Scan QR code or use installation link
4. Enable Data Roaming when traveling

Android tablets:
eSIM support varies by manufacturer and model. Check your specific tablet's specifications. Generally less common than on iPads.

Smartwatches with eSIM:
Smartwatches with cellular typically use a different eSIM system tied to your carrier. Lumbus eSIMs are designed for phones and tablets, not smartwatches.

Compatible (with carrier plan, not Lumbus):
- Apple Watch (GPS + Cellular models)
- Samsung Galaxy Watch (LTE models)
- Google Pixel Watch (LTE models)

Note for smartwatches:
Most cellular smartwatches require a plan through your primary carrier that extends your phone number to the watch. This is different from travel data eSIMs.

Surface devices:
- Microsoft Surface Pro X - Supports eSIM
- Microsoft Surface Duo - Supports eSIM
- Check individual model specifications

Before purchasing for tablet:
1. Verify your exact model supports eSIM
2. Check it has a SIM/cellular variant (WiFi-only models don't)
3. Ensure the device is carrier-unlocked
