- **Errors Fixed**: 8 (RLS disabled)
- **Warnings Fixed**: 7 (function search_path)
- **Performance Fixed**: 38 (auth_rls_initplan + multiple_permissive_policies + duplicate_index)
- **Info Fixed**: 4 (optional backend table policies)
- **Manual Action Required**: 1 (leaked password protection)

---

## ✅ FIXED: RLS Disabled Warnings

**Migration**: `supabase/migrations/008_enable_rls_security.sql`

### Tables Fixed (8)
1. ✅ `payout_commissions` - RLS enabled with service role + affiliate policies
2. ✅ `plans` - RLS enabled with service role + public read for active plans
3. ✅ `webhook_idempotency` - RLS enabled with service role only
4. ✅ `affiliate_stats_daily` - RLS enabled with service role + affiliate policies
5. ✅ `system_config` - RLS enabled with service role only
6. ✅ `webhook_events` - RLS enabled with service role only
7. ✅ `discount_code_usage` - RLS enabled with service role + user policies
8. ✅ `discount_codes` - RLS enabled with service role + public read for active codes

### Policy Strategy
- **Service role**: Full access to all tables (maintains existing API functionality)
- **Public**: Read-only access to active plans and valid discount codes
- **Authenticated users**: Can view their own discount usage, stats, and commissions
- **Backend operations**: Unaffected (all use service role key)

## ✅ FIXED: Function Search Path Warnings

**Migration**: `supabase/migrations/009_fix_function_search_path.sql`

### Functions Fixed (7)
1. ✅ `update_updated_at` - Added `SET search_path = public`
2. ✅ `generate_ref_code` - Added `SET search_path = public`
3. ✅ `ensure_ref_code` - Added `SET search_path = public`
4. ✅ `cleanup_old_webhook_idempotency` - Added `SET search_path = public`
5. ✅ `validate_discount_code` - Added `SET search_path = public`
6. ✅ `increment_discount_code_usage` - Added `SET search_path = public`
7. ✅ `update_discount_codes_updated_at` - Added `SET search_path = public`

### Security Improvements
- **SECURITY DEFINER**: Functions run with privileges of function owner
- **SET search_path = public**: Locks search_path to prevent SQL injection attacks
- **Attack Prevention**: Malicious users cannot hijack function calls by creating tables/functions in their own schema

## ✅ FIXED: Optional Backend Table Policies

**Migration**: `supabase/migrations/010_optional_rls_backend_tables.sql`

### Issue
These backend-only tables had RLS enabled but no policies, causing INFO-level warnings.

### Tables Fixed (4)
1. ✅ `affiliate_clicks` - Click tracking (backend only)
2. ✅ `affiliate_payouts` - Payout management (backend/admin only)
3. ✅ `fraud_flags` - Fraud detection (backend/admin only)
4. ✅ `order_attributions` - Attribution tracking (backend only)

### Solution
Added service role policies to all tables. These policies don't affect functionality (service role bypasses RLS anyway) but resolve the linter warnings and add defense-in-depth.

---

## ✅ FIXED: Performance Warnings

**Migration**: `supabase/migrations/011_fix_performance_warnings.sql`

### 1. auth_rls_initplan Warnings (16 Fixed)

**Issue**: RLS policies calling `auth.uid()` directly cause the function to re-evaluate for every row, degrading performance on large result sets.

**Solution**: Replace `auth.uid()` with `(select auth.uid())` to evaluate once per query.

**Policies Optimized**:
- `affiliates_select_own` and `affiliates_update_own`
- `Affiliates can view their own commissions`
- `Authenticated users can view their discount code usage`
- `orders_select_own` and `orders_update_own`
- `Affiliates can view their payout links`
- `Affiliates can view their daily stats`
- `payout_requests_select_own` and `payout_requests_insert_own`
- `user_profiles_select_own`, `user_profiles_insert_own`, and `user_profiles_update_own`

**Performance Impact**: Significant improvement on queries returning many rows (e.g., affiliate viewing all their commissions).

### 2. multiple_permissive_policies Warning (4 Fixed)

**Issue**: The `affiliates` table had two overlapping SELECT policies:
- `affiliates_select_active`: Allows viewing active affiliates
- `affiliates_select_own`: Allows viewing own affiliate record

Since both are permissive (OR logic), they overlap for authenticated users viewing their own active records, causing unnecessary policy evaluation overhead.

**Solution**: Combined into single optimized policy `affiliates_select_policy`:
```sql
USING (
  user_id = (select auth.uid())  -- Own record
  OR
  is_active = true               -- Any active affiliate
)
```

**Performance Impact**: Reduced policy evaluation overhead on affiliates table queries.

### 3. duplicate_index Warnings (25 Fixed)

**Issue**: Migration 000 created indexes, then migration 007 recreated them with `_v2` suffix. This resulted in duplicate indexes wasting disk space and slowing down write operations.

**Duplicate Indexes Removed**:

**Affiliate-related** (16 indexes):
- `idx_affiliates_user_id`, `idx_affiliates_ref_code`, `idx_affiliates_created_at`
- `idx_commissions_order_id`, `idx_commissions_affiliate_id`, `idx_commissions_status`
- `idx_affiliate_clicks_affiliate_id`, `idx_affiliate_clicks_created_at`
- `idx_affiliate_payouts_affiliate_id`, `idx_affiliate_payouts_status`
- `idx_payout_requests_affiliate_id`, `idx_payout_requests_status`
- `idx_payout_commissions_payout_id`, `idx_payout_commissions_commission_id`
- `idx_affiliate_stats_daily_affiliate_id`, `idx_affiliate_stats_daily_date`

**Order-related** (4 indexes):
- `idx_orders_user_id`, `idx_orders_status`, `idx_orders_created_at`, `idx_orders_iccid`

**Discount code** (4 indexes):
- `idx_discount_codes_code`, `idx_discount_codes_is_active`
- `idx_discount_code_usage_user_id`, `idx_discount_code_usage_discount_code_id`

**System** (1 index):
- `idx_webhook_events_order_id`

**Indexes Kept**: All `_v2` indexes from migration 007 (more optimized versions)

**Performance Impact**:
- Freed disk space (25 indexes × average index size)
- Faster INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations (fewer indexes to maintain)
- Cleaner query plans (no duplicate index choices confusing the planner)

## ⚠️ MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED: Leaked Password Protection

**Warning Level**: WARN
**Status**: Not Fixed (Requires Supabase Dashboard Action)

### Issue
Leaked password protection is currently disabled. Supabase Auth can check passwords against the HaveIBeenPwned.org database to prevent users from using compromised passwords.

### How to Enable

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Providers** → **Email**
3. Scroll to **Password Settings**
4. Enable **"Check password against HaveIBeenPwned database"**
5. Save changes

**Reference**: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/password-security#password-strength-and-leaked-password-protection

### Benefits
- Prevents users from setting passwords that have been compromised in known data breaches
- Improves overall account security
- No performance impact (check happens during registration/password change only)

### Impact
- **Low**: Only affects new user registrations and password changes
- **Recommended**: Enable this for improved security posture

## Deployment Instructions

### Apply Migrations

Run migrations in order:

```bash
# 1. Apply RLS security policies
supabase db push supabase/migrations/008_enable_rls_security.sql

# 2. Fix function search_path
supabase db push supabase/migrations/009_fix_function_search_path.sql

# 3. (Optional) Add backend table policies
supabase db push supabase/migrations/010_optional_rls_backend_tables.sql

# 4. Fix performance warnings
supabase db push supabase/migrations/011_fix_performance_warnings.sql
```

Or apply all pending migrations:

```bash
supabase db push
```

### Verify Fixes

After deployment, run the Supabase database linter again to verify all warnings are resolved:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Database** → **Linter**
2. Click **Refresh**
3. Verify only 1 warning remains (leaked password protection - manual action required)
4. Verify 0 errors and 0 performance warnings

---

## Testing Checklist

After applying migrations, verify:

- [ ] All API routes still work (they use service role)
- [ ] Admin operations function correctly
- [ ] User authentication flows work
- [ ] Webhook processing continues to work
- [ ] Public plan browsing works
- [ ] Discount code validation works
- [ ] Affiliate dashboard displays stats correctly
- [ ] No RLS-related errors in application logs

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, migrations can be rolled back in reverse order:

```bash
# Rollback performance fixes
supabase migration rollback 011_fix_performance_warnings

# Rollback optional backend policies
supabase migration rollback 010_optional_rls_backend_tables

# Rollback search_path fixes
supabase migration rollback 009_fix_function_search_path

# Rollback RLS policies
supabase migration rollback 008_enable_rls_security
```

However, rollback is **not recommended** as these migrations improve security and performance without breaking functionality.

## Architecture Notes

### Why This Works Without Breaking Changes

1. **Backend uses service role**: All API routes in `app/api/**/*.ts` use `lib/db.ts` which creates a Supabase client with the service role key
2. **Service role bypasses RLS**: Service role has full access regardless of RLS policies
3. **Browser client rarely queries these tables**: The anon key client (`lib/supabase-client.ts`) is only used for authentication
4. **Defense in depth**: Even if the anon key is leaked, these tables are now protected

### Database Access Patterns

**Service Role (bypasses RLS)**:
- All API routes
- Webhook handlers
- Admin operations
- Cron jobs

**Anonymous/Authenticated Keys (subject to RLS)**:
- User authentication flows
- Client-side queries (minimal usage)

## Security & Performance Improvements Summary

### Security Improvements
1. **RLS Protection**: 12 tables now protected from unauthorized access via anon key (8 main tables + 4 backend-only tables)
2. **Function Security**: 7 functions now immune to search_path manipulation attacks
3. **Defense in Depth**: Service role policies on backend-only tables
4. **Zero Downtime**: All changes are backward compatible
5. **Best Practices**: Following Supabase security recommendations

### Performance Improvements
1. **Query Optimization**: 16 RLS policies optimized with `(select auth.uid())` - eliminates per-row function evaluation
2. **Policy Consolidation**: Combined overlapping affiliates policies - reduced evaluation overhead
3. **Index Cleanup**: Removed 25 duplicate indexes - freed disk space and improved write performance
4. **Query Planning**: Cleaner execution plans without duplicate index confusion

### Impact
- **Security**: Enhanced protection against accidental anon key usage
- **Performance**: Faster user-scoped queries (orders, commissions, profiles, etc.)
- **Database Health**: Reduced disk usage, improved linter score
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner schema with no duplicates
